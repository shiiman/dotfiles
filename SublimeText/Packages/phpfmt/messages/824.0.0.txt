php.fmt
=======

Thank you for upgrading.

This package has been transferred by ST to a new maintainer, and you can find the code at https://github.com/driade/phpfmt8 . The goal is to improve it to make it fully support php 7.4 and php 8.x, which the original one lacked.

Please feel fee to open an issue or pull request if you find that something is not correctly working.

This release includes numerous improvements, with support for php 8 . Please check the commit history of the package if you want to know more https://github.com/driade/phpfmt8/commits/master .
