# Support for PHP 5.5 has been removed.

Due to the fact that PHP 5.5 support relied on a very old version of phpfmt,
this package can no longer guarantee that user experience with this mode will
remain of high quality. More importantly, PHP 5.5 is almost end-of-life and
will stop receiving security updates in July 2016.

If you run PHP 5.5 on your local server, the righ solution for you is to install
a standalone version of PHP 7 in a different folder, and point the plugin to
this binary.
